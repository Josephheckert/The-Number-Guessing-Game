# The-Number-Guessing-Game
Super Awesome Number Guessing Game

This purpose of this project is to provide a simple and fun game wherein a number between 1 and 10 is selected at random, and the user must guess numbers until guessing the correct number.
Count of the number of tries it takes the user to guess the number is recorded and set as the high score if lower than the current high score.
User will be prompted whether or not they would like to play the game again, and the program will loop until the user answers something other than "yes".

Errors are handled appropriately.

This program is written as a Python shell program, using the following concepts:
* Python scripts
* Random numbers (using Python random module)
* While loops
* Strings and string coercion
* Operators
* Exception handling
